Grails Selenium RC Plugin
=========================

The main reason for this fork is the upgrade to selenium 2.0rc2. I did this mainly to upgrade selenium to 2.0 with webdriver so I could test facebook canvas apps more easily. The inspiration came from this [post](http://jwbito.ballardview.com/2011/02/automated-test-for-facebook-canvas-apps.html)

This fork upgrades everything to grails 1.3.7, for the spock test suite spock-core is upgraded to [0.5-groovy-1.7](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.spockframework/spock-core/0.5-groovy-1.7).


Building/Testing
----------------

You should install [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) build tool. Then just do a gradle in the project root folder. If everything is ok you didn't brake anything. If it fails fix before pushing.
